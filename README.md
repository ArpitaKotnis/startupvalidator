What’s This?
The Startup Idea Validator is a simple and easy-to-use tool that helps you validate your startup ideas in just a few clicks. It uses Google Search and AI feedback to tell you if your idea already exists and provides suggestions on how to make it better.

If you’ve ever wondered, "Is my idea unique?" or "What should I improve?", this tool is designed to help you take your idea from maybe to definitely worth pursuing!

Why Build This?
We realized how much time we spent researching if an idea already existed or getting feedback from people who weren’t sure what we were talking about. This tool does all that for you — fast and easy. You get Google search results and AI feedback, all in one place.

Features
Google Search: Searches for similar ideas or products online and shows you the top results.

AI Feedback: (Optional) Powered by OpenAI, it gives you feedback on your idea to help you improve it.

Streamlit Interface: It’s built with Streamlit, which makes the tool super easy to use.

How to Use
Install the Required Libraries
Open your terminal and run the following command:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install streamlit googlesearch-python openai
Optional: Set Up OpenAI

If you want AI feedback, you need an OpenAI API key (you can get it by signing up at OpenAI).

Insert your API key into the code (look for the line with openai.api_key = "your-api-key-here").

Run the App
In your terminal, run this command:

bash
Copy
Edit
streamlit run startup_idea_validator.py
This will open the tool in your web browser, and you can start typing your idea!

Validate Your Idea

Type your startup idea into the text box and click "Validate".

The tool will show you if there are similar ideas out there and, if you’ve set up AI, it will provide feedback to help you improve your idea.

Sample Output
If you type in: "A mobile app that helps people track mental health using voice journaling."

The tool might show you links to similar apps like:

Woebot

Replika

Wysa

And the AI feedback could be:

Idea Strength: Mental health tech is growing, but competition is fierce.

Differentiation: Try to make it unique by focusing on a specific niche (e.g., students, elderly).

Opportunity: Mental health apps with voice journaling are still a growing market, and there's space for innovation!

Why This is Useful
As students and budding entrepreneurs, we get excited about our ideas. But the real question is: Is it already out there? If yes, how can you make it better? This tool helps you answer that question quickly, so you don’t waste time on an idea that’s already been done or gives you tips on how to make it stand out.
